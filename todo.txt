GROUP2:
  -- Short circuiting (DISTRIB)
  -- Problem with return (multiple returns in the same block are not allowed, however
      every basic block must have a terminating statement- theoritika einai ok)

wrong testcases:
  by-ref (instruciton does not dominate all uses)
  shadow (instruciton does not dominate all uses)
  simple-if5 (instruciton does not dominate all uses)
  simple-nest2 (instruciton does not dominate all uses)

proposed and implemented solution is marking block as uncreachable.
That solves the non terminating block problem, at least as far as I can see.
