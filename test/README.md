## Test cases format
In order to run the test script the `.tony` files should have the following comment at the start :
```
<*
 * Test case: example.tony
 * Result: Pass/Fail
 *>
```
where `example.tony` is the name of the file and the result should be `Pass` if the file shall pass the semantic analysis and `Fail` otherwise.
